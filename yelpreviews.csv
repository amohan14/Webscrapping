Trang P.,"Seattle, WA",5,5/3/2020,"This place is such a gem! I have yet to try a pastry I do not like. I've had their passion fruit tart, earl grey croissant, blueberry danish (?), salted chocolate chip cookie- all have been wonderfully delicious!Today, I ordered the salted chocolate cookie and fruits and lemon curd for pickup and the staff gave me two extra pastries. Granted, it was 10 mins to closing but such a kind gesture. This shows they don't sell day old items and really value their patrons. If you haven't checked them out- please do. I mean.. what more enticing do you need than Earl Grey Croissant?!"
C M.,"Seattle, WA",5,4/25/2020,"This has become my favorite bakery, we're able to order online the night before and pick up the fresh pastries the next morning. Such a treat!"
Rachel R.,"Vancouver, Canada",5,5/11/2020,"I love this bakery, and it's my parents' favorite bakery as well! I live in Ireland right now, and I ordered pastries to be delivered on Mother's Day during the pandemic. The owner delivered them himself! He's very nice and loves having conversations about pastries. Thank you so much, Celine, for making this Mother's Day special!"
Lizzie M.,"Seattle, WA",5,5/30/2020,The best pastries in all of Seattle. On par with a Parisian Patisserie! The Whipped Strawberry Chocolate Cream Croissant was to die for although everything was 10/10. The owners were kind and welcoming and their online ordering system is seamless. This place is worth making a trip to! Will be back soon.
Fiona X.,"Seattle, WA",5,5/11/2020,"We got almond croissants and kouign amanns here for Mother's Day and omg...this may be my favorite pastry shop in all of Seattle.Everything was flaky, rich yet light, moist on the outside but crisp on the outside, and just so perfect. I love how the pastries have the right amount of sweetness and really let the ingredients shine. The almond paste in the almond croissants weren't too sweet like some of the other almond croissants I've had.We will definitely be back!"
I Need A.,"Edmonds, WA",5,7/12/2020,"The pastries are excellent, the desserts are excellent, and the service is excellent. I wish I'd found this shop sooner. I highly recommend trying it out."
Andrea O.,"Bellevue, WA",4,5/16/2020,"Cute little pastry shop with a European vibe. Pastry selection is usually wide, not so much today, probably due to the covid lockdown. Got a chocolate tart and a raspberry mascarpone cruffin, both delicious. The cruffin is crunchy and sugary on the outside and soft and amazing inside. I thought I'd eat only half because it's big and calorie dense looking, but after the first half, I went for an additional quarter and after that I finished it. Really good! I'd preferred it without raspberry sauce/jam, maybe with custard cream or hazelnut chocolate (Nutella), but that's me. Somehow I missed the praline hazelnut mousse, I'll go back to get that soon. Highly recommended. It's a 4* borderline 5"
Stephanie H.,"Denver, CO",4,12/27/2019,"The pastry selection was quite large and it was really hard to pick which pastries to get! All of the pastries looked really delicious in the glass case. We finally decided on the creme brulee danish and two cappuccinos.The danish was really flaky and delicious. The brulee filling could have used more flavor, but otherwise was very good. The cappuccinos were nothing special and the foam was not as smooth as I typically like. Overall I would love to go again and try more of their pastries! It was good, but not the best french pastry place I have tried."
Ada N.,"Goleta, CA",5,11/16/2019,Recommend: Pistachio croissant Turkey and Swiss croissant sandwich(bomb flavor)Feels like this breakfast/brunch place is extremely popular among the neighborhood. Cashiers can recognize lots of customers!
Em G.,"Seattle, WA",5,10/30/2019,"A really cute patisserie shop not too far from the zoo. A comfy place to get some work done, meet with friends or just take a break and enjoy some great food. Celine Patisserie's staff  is warm and welcoming and the space is spacious and bright. They are serving European style savory and sweet baked goods, individual desserts and whole cakes and tarts to share. I ordered the Raspberry and Mascarpone Cruffin. If you never had a cruffin, its croissant dough shaped or placed in a muffin liner/cup. In Celine's case its rolled in sugar then baked and stuffed with raspberry jam and mascarpone cheese. Such a fantastic combination. It too bad that I was too full otherwise I would have ordered more. But give Celine Patisserie a try if you're in the area. It might be a life changer."
Jun Li Z.,"Seattle, WA",5,2/29/2020,"Came here with my girlfriend last Sunday and their croissants are hands down, the bomb! I have been to Cafe Besalu, Princi (Starbucks bakery), Pike Place's bakeries, as well as few other bakeries in Seattle and this place has the best croissants I have had as long as I can remember.  Why is it good? It's crispy and crunchy on the outside, and its textures inside are soft once you bite into it. Not soft like a-day-old or a few hours old croissants. These were fresh and I don't think they mess with pastries. It is no wonder it's five stars!I ordered their custard filled croissants and that is by far the best kind. I got the pistachio croissant and it is not that great. I wasn't a huge fan of that flavor or their tzatziki cheese croissant which I got to go. I ordered a chai latte with soy and that was also prepared well. I'd come here again!"
Stephanie A.,"Monroe, WA",5,7/6/2020,All I can say is Wow!  I love their Earl Grey Croissant!  There are so many wonderful items to choose from that you just have to go and try something.
Sara C.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/5/2020,Amazing French patisserie with modern twists on the classics. Beautiful and delicious.
Annabelle A.,"San Francisco, CA",5,7/11/2020,Best pastries ever! Staff is friendly and the pastries are not only delicious but spectacular in aesthetics! Cute inside great coffee and hot chocolate I go here with my mom every time she visits Seattle from Florida she can't miss it!
Vision L.,"WA, WA",5,11/24/2019,"So good. If you're a carb-phile like me, this place is for you! We stopped by for breakfast before the Woodland Zoo bc I can't resist unique-sounding croissants. Everything just tasted frickin' delicious: Earl grey croissantSavory mushroom galleteSavory egg and sausage galleteBlueberry lemon danishPain au chocolatThe end of the meal was one of those moments where I wished I were a cow just so I could have 3 other stomachs to fill. Note: Kid-friendly in terms of kid chairs but no changing table in bathroom."
Tracy A.,"Kirkland, WA",5,11/20/2019,"I'm still dreaming of the pistachio croissant I had.  It was just the right texture, just the right chew, a dusting of pistachio on the outside, and a creamy, smooth, flavorful pistachio filling on the inside.  The cheese galette with raspberries was delicious as well.  The cases are a stunning visual display of decadence that left me awestruck and dumbfounded.  I can only return and keep returning until I've tried absolutely everything they have to offer in addition to getting the pistachio croissant each and every time.  If I had to knock them on anything, there was no where to sit because every table was occupied."
Lydia L.,"Seattle, WA",5,5/29/2019,"*** 4.7s stars ***We shared one pistachio croissant, one cream cheese & berries, one cruffin, and one raspberry chocolate mousse (recommended by the staff)).Favorites - 1. Raspberry chocolate mousse!!! Fine and smooth, rich but not overwhelming, delightful but not overly sweet. Subtle flavors of raspberry and chocolate perfectly fuse with each other, giving the best dynamic.2. Cruffin - love love love the fruit jam and cream inside the cruffin! So creamy, so fruity, yet perfectly balanced with each other. I was never a huge fan of cream or fruit jam but this was too good to not have. Average -Pistachio Croissant and Cream Cheese & Berries. I expected much more from these two but was let down a little. Great vibes, very cute and organic interior decor. I wish it was closer to downtown area so I could visit more often."
Ann D.,"Renton, WA",5,10/28/2019,"Just fantastic. I loved my first taste so much, I dragged my husband here three days later to eat their early grey croissant again.  Everything here is perfectly executed, beautifully presented, and tastes wonderful, without being too sweet.  It rivals patisseries in France.Obviously, my favorite was the earl grey croissant, which is a light and flaky croissant filled with a fragrant earl grey cream.  The creme brulee danish is a discovery, and the kouign aman is a classic done right.My first time here was on a Thursday morning at 7am, and I had the pastries packed up to go.  On my second time here, my husband and I stayed to eat our sweets on the premises.  We also tried their chai, which is a generous serving of housemade tea which has a lovely warm bite to it.  Their cafe vennoise was enjoyed by my husband.Service is always very friendly.  The bathroom is unisex and clean.  Street parking was easy on both occasions that I came to visit.  For what you get, the prices are reasonable and comparable to other pastry shops.My only complaint?  I wish Celine wasn't so far away from my home!"
Katy B.,"Jacksonville, FL",5,7/14/2020,best breakfast sandwich ever! everything is delicious and the staff rocks. thanks Alex!
Diksha N.,"Seattle, WA",5,4/14/2019,One of the better french bakeries I have been to in recent months. The location is nice and it has a good vibe with adequate space. I went in looking for the orange baked goods but they ran out of it. I had the custard filled cruffin with dark chocolate and it was super yumm !. The croissant was flaky and buttery with the custard not being too sweet while the chocolate being a good balance between milk and dark. Had the mocha too which was really good too ! Loved the service and the seating with tulips and rainier paintings. Will definitely go back there for brunch and try to get what they ran out of !
Tiffany Z.,"Seattle, WA",5,4/2/2019,"My bff got me a box of goodies from here and I think I'm in love! I got the pistachio croissant, raspberry mascarpone cruffin, and fruit custard danish. The fruit (blueberry) custard danish was surprisingly not sweet at all! Very flaky with natural sweetness from the blueberries. The pistachio croissant was light and flaky with a densely packed pistachio paste. It was not sweet and a nice nutty taste! The raspberry mascarpone was the sweetest of them all. It's sugar coated with lots of unnecessary sugar, making a big delicious mess. The raspberry jam was very sweet but when eaten with the mascarpone filling, it balanced out nicely! I use to think bakery Nouveau was the best croissant spot but after trying Celine, I'm not too sure anymore! It's a lot lighter and less sweet in comparison!"
Phuong T.,"San Francisco, CA",5,5/30/2020,"Try their croissants - any or all of them!!! The croissants are super fresh and flakey, I constantly compare any croissant I have to Celines's and they definitely set the bar high on quality and taste. The coffee is great here too, I usually get a vanilla latte and if hungry, I'll get the ham and Brie croissant sandwich which comes with a side of veggies and extra Brie on top of the croissant, a little extra Brie? Why not!! You may see the owners working on a daily bases and they're amazing at what they do."
Le T.,"Seattle, WA",5,10/13/2019,"The best the best guys. Its a small humble shop on a busy business street. The store is quite hard to see so drive slowly you will see it. The staffs were frienly and helpful. There are a variety of cakes and pasties food. The display and decoration just gave me a good impression of how much they love their job. The cake was creamy and not too sweet. The pasties and sandwiches, all of the ingredients were just enough to not overwhelming other flavors. The coffee was okay, but I am not a daily coffee drinker so you might find its good. Overall, this is a hidden gem, give it a try guys."
P J.,"Bellevue, WA",5,4/14/2019,YUM!!!!! That is all I have to say. So I happen across the Yelp profile as I saw scrolling through looking for a good bakery and Celine popped up. I was shocked and the number of ratings vs it's rating itself. Very impressive and I understand why. They had some amazing creations and combinations of flavors. So many that I have to come back to try more. I really liked how they had danish-like croissants that were also savory. All the ones I have with my friends were amazing. No soggy pastry. All were flaky and crispy. I am definitely going back to try others.
Leah F.,"Seattle, WA",5,4/8/2019,"I can't even begin to describe how much I love this bakery. It's probably one of my favorites in all of a Seattle. It has a small neighborhood vibe too it which I adore and makes me very happy. The people that work there are always so so friendly and make the experience even better. Let me just say this now hands down some of the best croissants you will ever have.. ever. I have had croissants in Spain and France and this place definitely compares to some of the top best I've ever had. The flavors of the croissants often change keeping it super fun and exciting. Some of my favorites I've had here is the pistachio and berry mascarpone croissants. I'm just so glad they have such a unique selection because it can be hard to find that sometimes. They also serve croissant sandwiches which are also amazing!! I can't explain but some how they have perfected the art of perfectly flakey, tasty bakery items. Every single thing I've had from here has been amazing and it keeps me coming back for more. The breakfast galettes amazing, the quiche amazing, mocha amazing, fresh squeezed orange juice amazing, you probably get it by now.. everything is so amazing I want to cry. Beware once you go here you will have a new favorite which you crave every weekend.. and you might go in saying you are only going to get one or two things but good luck because you will walk out with more then your belly can handle, trust me!"
Nancy W.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/8/2019,"Now THIS is a european-style bakery! It's absolutely fantastic, out of this world and everything in between. In the pictures I have posted with this review, you can see layer upon layer of the puff pastry and I don't think I've ever seen so many in my life at any patisserie. I sampled three or four items and my only suggestion would be for the jelly filled pastry to be filled all the way down to the bottom so that you can enjoy every bite. The owners are husband and wife, (forgive me if you're not) and they were the most pleasant people to talk with. They also take so much pride in what they do and it shows in every bite. Atmosphere is very welcoming and the display cases are absolutely beautiful. I've already been here a few times, bringing friends who never knew about this place. A MUST GO TO!!!"
Karen L.,"Seattle, WA",4,8/16/2019,"The pastries and desserts here are pretty unique, and best of all, delicious! My husband and I had the strawberry pistachio croissant, creme brulee danish, and a lemon tart. They were all delicious, especially the creme brulee danish! Yum! I'd love to try their other pastries. All the little cakes looked super delicious and also very visually appealing. For example, our tart had a little lemon shaped cream thing on top, which was so cute! It was very creative and super fun. I definitely recommend this patisserie."
Jesena M.,"Bellevue, WA",5,2/17/2020,"Amazing little shop that has some of the best pastries and desserts in the area. My husband was so in love with his Nutella Croissant, he said it's been the best he had in a long time. I had one of their mousse desserts and oh my - they are a decadent treat! The place also has this cute feel, totally worth the drive and staff is super friendly."
Preetha A.,"Seattle, WA",5,12/26/2018,"Excellent quality, good service and fantastic selection. Each time we come here we try something new and are never disappointed. You can see that they are very skilled and each item on their bakery shelf, pastry shelf is sheer perfection. Every week, they add something new. I love how they are constantly innovating and adding creative items to their menus. I would rate this the best bakery in seattle- hands down.My recommendations: Croissants- any of them, they have a fantastic butter croissant that is just the right amount of flaky and crunch, without being too heavy on the butter . Other bakeries make them too dry where they crumble all over you without each bite and there is nothing to bite into. They have pistachio, almond , nutella and some other unique seasonal ones. Galettes- their goat cheese galette is always a solid winner. They have sausage, ham and other variations.Other solid winners- ham and brie sandwich, their tarts for those with an ultra sweet tooth, macarons and so much more. Great coffee Lastly, the service and amazing welcome you get from the folks behind the counter who also happen to be the owners- thats the icing on the cake. Our go to weekend spot, anytime of the day. Their mini financiers using almond meal are just the right amount of crumble and sponge cake texture. It feels like you are the judge in the great British Baking Competition or a similar show. You actually get what they are talking about when you experience it here."
Ashwin R.,"Seattle, WA",4,7/4/2019,"Celine has become an abolute jem of a neigbhorhood cafe, and its pastries are among the best in the city. The specialty croissants are wonderful, though you may find better standard butter croissants in town (Seawolf, Rosellini's come to mind). That being said, the diversity and drinks offered put this at the top of the list of any pastry officionado."
Milena B.,"Seattle, WA",5,12/25/2019,"My new favorite place in the city. This place ticks all the boxes: cute and warm interior, excellent coffee, pastries, savory options, and desserts. I've tried the pistachio, earl grey, and nutella croissants. The earl grey was my favorite. Not too sweet bit delicious. I'm no quiche connoisseur, but the mushroom quiche was fantastic. Egg and bacon gallette was equally delicious. The raspberry marscapone cruffin was a little sweet for me, so I think it's perfect for cutting in half and sharing. Or save for the next day! My most favorite item so far; the strawberry white chocolate mousse bar. Not completely certain that's what it's called, but it's a white bar displayed with the desserts. It's rich, smooth and everything you'd want in a dessert. Also, my americano was perfect. It's worth a visit just for the coffee. It's rare to find a place that does everything this well!"
Mitchell V.,"Seattle, WA",5,6/28/2019,"I love pastries. Pastries are worth getting up at 7AM on a Saturday and that is exactly what I did. A French family behind me in line said I made the right choice by coming here. Their tagline is modern traditional and that is a perfect way to describe this place. The croissants are airy, flaky and buttery just like you want them but come in fun flavors like baklava or pistachio. The fruit tarts are extensive in variety. They are delicate with fruit and custard yet rich with the chocolate base and the dense dough that acts as a vessel for it all. However, the real winner was the creme brulee croissant. I don't really know how to describe it other than saying what I started with. It's worth waking up at 7AM on a Saturday."
Jessica G.,"Seattle, WA",4,12/9/2018,"What a great little right and really close to my neighborhood!There is no shortage of tasty French treats here. From cookies to cakes, they have it all. Particular favorites are cruffins (flaky pastry filled with cream) and fruit tarts. Always fresh, sweet, and delicious. There is also a full espresso bar, so you can sip your caffeinated beverage of choice. The inside is pretty modern and very clean but also inviting. There are books on the shelves that patrons are welcome to read while hanging out. While it's not huge, it's spacious enough for quite a few people to lounge. Decently priced and conveniently located to the Phinney area and the zoo. I will definitely be back!"
K S.,"Seattle, WA",3,7/4/2020,"This is a pretty place with pretty pastries. I tried an almond croissant and a raspberry cruffin. They both had the texture of a soft bread rather than a buttery croissant, and I did not get the wonderful aroma and taste of butter, nor the crunch of crust, that come with a traditional French almond croissant. So I will henceforth go down the street, where butter is abundant."
Yen D.,"Seattle, WA",5,4/30/2019,"Definitely get the pistachio and baklava croissant.  They have various flaky pastries.  We did try their raspberry and cream croissant but with the sugar in it combined with the American type sweetness of the cream and jam, I felt like it was too sweet for me."
Kat L.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/26/2019,"I was recently introduced to this patisserie, and I love these pastries!  I had a box of 3 pastries and ate them all within 2 hours.  I didn't even remember to take pictures.  I intended to share these, but they were all in my stomach before I got home.  I ate one custard and berries galette, one raspberry mascarpone cruffin, and one swiss cheese mushroom galette.  The swiss cheese mushroom galette was my favorite!  I have not had a more delicious mushroom pastry, and I love mushrooms.  The mushrooms are soft, tender, and flavorful.  They are not overcooked and chewy.  The pastry had a slight sweetness which was surprising. The Cruffin is interesting.  It's a flaky pastry muffin filled with raspberry jam and mascarpone cream.   There is a little too much jam which made it sweeter than I like, but it is balanced by the soft cream.  It was a similar idea to the custard and berries galette.  This was like a Cruffin split in the middle.  A buttery flaky pastry with a smear of custard and decorated with berries on top.  I wish I lived closer to Celine Patisserie, but it's probably better for my health that I don't."
Wendy S.,"Seattle, WA",5,11/6/2018,"I got here at 3:49 (they close at 4) and I was able to pick up the last few butter croissants! They were baked to the perfect color....flakey, dark caramel color on the outside, soft and fluffy with many, many layers of bouncy dough inside. It was really good when I toasted it at home! I will be coming back soon to try out the flavored croissants, but I wanted to start with the basic butter croissant to get a feel for this patisserie. I love croissants! I would recommend this place to all croissant lovers! Their tarts looked really good too but it was 1.75 for a small and 5 dollars for a large. Kind of steep...but I'll probably still try it one time!"
Jen C.,"Seattle, WA",5,11/3/2018,Amazingly delicious pastries and they make you feel so welcome being there. I am so glad there's this little gem in North SeattleOn top of that they ran out of the chocolate croissant and I was super sad. As I was about to leave a new batch came out. The lady at the cashier gave me one and refuse to let me pay for it. Super nice folks
A B.,"Fort Benning, GA",5,6/9/2020,"We drove an hour to get here on a rainy day to celebrate DDay with some French pastries. We met one of the owners and he was so kind. The pastries were aesthetically perfect and they were absolutely delicious. Loved the coffee as well! Adding it to my preferred list for Seattle without a doubt. Cute neighborhood too, could be fun for coffee and a treat followed by some shops!"
Allie F.,"Tucson, AZ",5,8/28/2019,"I would die for this place. No joke, no dramatics, I am in love. I crave it everyday and will never find anything like it in Tucson. When I get back to Seattle I cannot promise that I won't eat this every single day. We got the sun-dried tomato gallette, passionfruit tart and raspberry mascarpone cruffin. Where to even start....The gallette? Perfect amount of crunchy flakiness. A perfect savory flavor to have after all the sweets. The passionfruit tart, UGH, I LOVE passionfruit. This was very clearly made with actual passionfruit, not that straight sugar mess. It was perfectly tart and sour while also maintaining sweetness. And the cruffin is something I dreamed about but didn't know that I truly needed it in my life until I had it at Celine. Whenever friends travel to Seattle and ask me where to go, I practically shout at them to haul a*s over here, lol."
Tori Z.,"Seattle, WA",5,4/16/2019,"Hidden Seattle gem, nestled away on Phinney Ridge this is one of the best if not the best pastry shops in Seattle. This french bakery has everything you're looking for from tasty croissants, to galettes, and french takes on more American treats. My favorite pastries are the monkey bread, bacon breakfast galette, and of course any type of croissant. The pastries are so good I can picture myself back in France. They also have a great dessert case with tarts, mousses, and ganaches."
Michael A.,"Shoreline, WA",4,3/31/2019,"Solid amandine croissant! The croissant was generously filled with the characteristic sweet almond paste I love in almond croissants and covered with an ample amount of almonds. I especially loved the crispy bits on the end! I say the croissant was pretty decent, but I do wish it were a little flakier on the inside--it was a bit too saturated by butter, if that makes sense. Still, overall good! The americano (to pair with the croissant) was also nice and smooth.The place definitely has a nice, neighborhood feel to it and vibe -- lots of families dropping by to partake of morning pastries (at least on Sunday)."
M S.,"Oakland, CA",5,8/16/2019,"I visited Celine once yet, and I already want to come back asap. I had one swiss cheese mushroom galette, one raspberry mascarpone cruffin and a chai latte. The mushroom galette and the chai latte were so very good!!! Like the best chai latte in my life cause for me it's been kinda hard to get a decent rich flavored chai latte anywhere..! I defo revisit Celine!"
Thao N.,"Seattle, WA",4,8/3/2019,Beautifully crafted egg and bacon galette (~$7.50). The perfectly flaky pastry combined with the toppings made it a great savory breakfast item. The pastry was as flaky as my most flaky friends LOL. The texture made each bite fun. The egg yolk was fully cooked but still had a silky taste. The bacon tastes pretty generic but added a great savory layer. The basil pieces were a nice touch and added a necessary flavor profile. I'm not a fan of tomatoes but it went pretty well with all the other toppings. There are a few tables inside the store so you can sit and enjoy your pastry! The staff was nice and offered to warm the galette so definitely ask if you'd like yours more toasty! They had a variety of savory and sweets pastry/dessert that were pleasing to the eyes. I can't wait to go back to try more! A must try bakery in the neighborhood! You can find parking behind the building in the neighborhood blocks.
James T.,"Shoreline, WA",5,4/29/2018,"Craving for European pastries? A visit to Celine patisserie is your best bet! Strategically situated near Greenlake, this place is often teemed with both pastries pundits and neighborhood locals alike.They have abundant options but are mainly known for their croissants, tarts, galettes, danishes, cheesecakes, and macarons. The croissants and galletes I've tried were first-rate! They were buttery, flaky, crispy, and not too sweet/salty! My personal favorites are the matcha marscapone croissant, babka croissant, and bacon galette (make sure you ask for fried egg on top of your galette, it's a game changer!) The lemon meringue tart was also flavorful and refreshing!Don't forget to get a cup coffee or tea for a complete European patisserie experience! Owners / staffs are also very insightful and amiable. A 5-star experience indeed!"
Sugandha S.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/24/2019,What a great collection of pastries. I loved the Earl grey croissant and the bacon sandwich. We had the creme brulee Danish too and it was so good. The people are really nice here.. I am a big fan of this place.  No wonder this is rated 5 stars.
Adam K.,"New York, NY",5,7/27/2019,"Phenomenal coffee, even more phenomenal people, sinfully delicious pastries... A neighborhood staple and much deserving of all 5 stars and it's steady stream of repeat customers. Immaculately clean and comfortable inside with an extensive menu of options and in-house baked treats. YUM!"
Tom V.,"Seattle, WA",5,5/23/2020,"Celine Patisserie was already one of my favorite cafes in Seattle before the pandemic--the space is friendly and open yet cozy, the staff is great, and the pastries are simply the best around. But the way they've adapted to the quarantine conditions has put them firmly in the top spot for me. Their website is easy to use, updates frequently, and the system just hums along. Having them around during this time has been a godsend."
Chad R.,"Greenbelt, MD",5,10/1/2019,"This is my favorite coffee shop in Seattle. The crew at Celine are consummate professionals in their craft and besides their excellent service, they are also the best bakery in Seattle.I've had friends from all over the world come visit me in Seattle and I always recommend they check at Celine. They are never disappointed."
Marty J.,"San Francisco, CA",5,5/23/2020,Had a chance to try a good selection of pastries from here lately.  Remarkable quality and flavor.  A true gem in Greenwood and only a few blocks away!
Mojdeh S.,"Seattle, WA",5,2/5/2018,"How I heard of this place: Walking by on a lovely summer morning, I noticed that the once-(always closed, never open) wine store located in this space had become a beautiful, inviting, warm coffee shop and bakery. I knew I had to return. And stat.Type of cuisine: French, buttery baked goods for breakfast, brunch and any time.French macarons, tarts and cakes to take to a party or home for a special evening grace the enticing, glass displays surrounding the kitchen area, where owner/baker extraordinaire creates her beautifully delectable pastries. A grand selection of Illy espresso beverages, as well as refrigerated juices, sodas and the like.Ambiance: Open, inviting, spacious and clean, a modern and welcoming European cafe awaits patrons to enter its glass doors, just beyond the small outdoor patio. Indoors, a floor-to-ceiling shelving unit is built into the wall, where ornaments are sparingly displayed.Tables with chairs for small and large parties are available for seating immediately ahead, and to the right, complete with banquette at the windows for street-facing, people watching seats. Lights are dim and the floor-to-ceiling windows facing Greenwood Avenue add natural lighting to round out the ambient nature of the patisserie.Order at the corner of the display counter, and await your beverages and warmed pastries to the right. For drip coffee and accoutrements, continue to the right, past the tavolata, where you can dress your beverage and return to find your seats.What I ordered: On my second visit in, I sampled the Cheese & Onion ""Croissant"" ($3.80) with a small (8oz) mocha.On a return visit, Thursday, 11 January 2018: After returning a number of times, I remembered to take photos of a subsequent visit's loot. For my husband, Quiche Lorraine ($6.80), for me a broccoli-cheddar quiche, and for our little one, the Breakfast Gallette.We must have grabbed our beverages too soon,as we were graced with shot glasses of whipped cream on the side of our 12-ounce Mocha, 12-ounce Hot Chocolate, and 20-ounce Caramello!What I loved: Everything. The butter, flaky, golden pastry to the flavorful and abundant filling satisfied with each bite. The mocha, creamy and dark.Why I loved it: The friendliest, most hard-working owners to have graced a Seattle bakery, remembering me each time I visit, asking about my family, friends (who live in the condos above), and thanking me for returning. Well, of course! With pastries and service this good, I'll be back. Again and again.Cost: Average ($3 - $6 per pastry; $3 - $6 per espresso beverage)"
Ashley K.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/2/2018,"Loved this place. We picked it out after a rave review in some local foodie publication (Eater? Seattle Met?) that called it 'an adventure.' So, off we went with a couple other friends to have a bakery adventure. The four of us all shared a little bit of everything: ham and cheddar croissant, chocolate hazelnut croissant, baklava croissant (!), Monkey bread and the favorite: strawberry mascarpone. It was creamy and not too sweet and perfectly flaky. Everything else also hit the spot, but that one was a perfect balance of flavors. I enjoyed the baklava croissant, as it's hands down one of my favorite desserts. This was good, but I would have liked to have had a little more filling.Besides the great pastries, the place was open and not too crowded, which I really appreciated. Oftentimes places are packed to the brim with noise and it makes it hard for me to relax and enjoy my morning bite. This was a good level of calm to customers. It was also very clean, and the folks were nice"
Tom A.,"Seattle, WA",5,2/29/2020,The best croissants I've had outside of France. Breakfast sandwiches are really tasty too. Good coffee and nice atmosphere!
Marcela V.,"Seattle, WA",5,6/20/2019,"I've really been meaning to go to this place more often. It is a short walk from my house and has the most delicious selection of pastries and coffees. It is the perfect Saturday morning coffee shop to stop by with a good book. They also have a little bit of outdoor seating, so you can bring your dog if you sit outside. They have so many options as far as pastries go, both sweet and savory. I personally have had the quiche and it's amazing."
Catherine L.,"Seattle, WA",2,7/7/2019,"I was really looking forward to this. But was disappointed. The pistachio croissant tasted like it was a day old, with a slight fridge taste. And I tasted the free scone, I am glad it was free. Because I would have been annoyed to have paid money for it, it definitely was a day old"
Lauren G.,"Denver, CO",5,6/26/2019,Wow - that might have been the best croissant I've ever tasted. I got the chocolate hazelnut (not to be confused with the Nutella) and it was mind blowing!  Crispy and flaky and buttery like a real French croissant should be!  So delicious. Lots of chocolate and hazelnut balanced perfectly with the pastry. I wish I would have tried more stuff! I don't live near here but this place might be worth the detour back!
Jeehae H.,"Seattle, WA",5,5/8/2019,"This is a French style bakery where the pastries are not too butterysweet but just right. We tried both fruit tarts (blueberry and rasberry), creamcheese berries pastry, and a chocolate mousse cake. Premium quality desserts and I just know that other pastries will taste just as good. Definitely worth the trip to this gem."
A G.,"Southern California, CA",1,5/10/2020,"The worst service I have EVER received. I called before ordering online to ensure they could deliver the next day. They said yes just put the address in the notes when you order. On their website they have the zip codes the deliver to and the one I needed was listed. I placed the order and when receiving a text saying it was ready for pickup I called and asked about it. The man told me no they don't deliver to that zip code and when I told him I called before and it was listed on their website that they deliver to that zip code he yelled at me and said its 14 minutes away and continued yelling over me and said I didn't understand. I have never been belittled and treated so horribly by a person. Terrible customer service, you do not yell at your customers and not let them speak especially when the info speaks for itself on the website."
Julie L.,"King, WA",5,5/21/2019,"What makes a great bakery? Delicious baked goods that I could no way possibly make myself and nice people and a clean environment. Hemp milk as an alternative would also be awesome but I won't knock them a star for that. Employees nice despite a little snippy attitude on my part. Great variety of savory and sweet baked goods to choose from. I had the fruit danish, reheated. I shared with my gf who is part French and she exclaimed, ""oooh, that crust!!"" The pastry was flaky with density goodness. Space is large for ample seating. Dogs have some patio space, too. Looking forward to my next visit. I do believe the creme brulee pastry had my name on it."
Desiree C.,"Seattle, WA",4,10/26/2018,"So. Many. Pastries. Not. Enough. Room. In. My. Stomach. Great patisserie in a quaint little neighborhood. The owner here is super helpful and kind. We asked so many questions about their pastries cause we were so indecisive about which delicious concoction to order. Not only was he patient with us, but made great recommendations about what to order! If you want to get the full experience, definitely come in closer to the morning because sometimes they run out of pastries and stop baking those for the day (we came in late afternoon and they had run out of a few of the pastries that they were known for).Really enjoy getting work done here as their work space is nice and open and it never gets so busy that it's too loud to get things done. Nothing beats a warmed up pastry paired with a cup of hot coffee and getting a load of work done!"
Magdalena R.,"Toronto, Canada",5,9/26/2018,"What a great find! We had some out of town visitors, and we stumbled into to this little fantastic cafe after exploring Seattle. The owners were so nice and welcoming. I stood there trying to decide on what amazing pastry to eat for what seemed like forever. It was NOT an easy choice. Everything looked picture perfect, and smelled beyond yummy. I went with the peach pastry. It was perfection. Fresh, crunchy, soft, gooey, not too sweet. Paired with a perfect macchiato. My taste buds and belly were in heaven."
Rachel K.,"Seattle, WA",2,4/11/2019,"I'm so surprised by the reviews of this place. Please know: I really *want* to like it. The space is gorgeous and the location really needed a coffee shop. The pastries are ok, but they're a far cry from Rossellini's or Fresh Flours. But the coffee...the coffee is T E R R I B L E. Consistently. But this week it was undrinkable. I keep trying to get fancier: americano - blah, so maybe I'll add some milk. Latte - over-milked, what happened to my coffee? Cortado - could you burn the coffee any more?"
Nicole H.,"Lynnwood, WA",5,5/12/2019,Some of the best croissants and tarts in the city! The seating inside is comfortable and inviting--I love the large bookshelf with art/books/etc. and the open windows which allow for lots of light. The staff are friendly and parking is easy in the neighborhood.
Derek P.,"Seattle, WA",5,11/11/2019,The type of pastry shop where you leave with one sweet item in hand thinking 'what other days of the week do I have time to visit and try something else?' The strategic placement of smaller pastries closer to checkout will manipulate you into walking away with tiny sweet snacks for later. You've been warned.
Nicole B.,"Saint Paul, MN",5,9/22/2017,"I wish I could give Celine 20 stars, that's how much I love this place! This is now my by far, go-to favorite for coffee & pastries in the neighborhood. Since discovering it a couple weeks ago, I've been most weekend days and even during the week to do work!The ambiance here is amazing!! The decor is gorgeous (& comfortable!), with tons of seating options, from two-top tables, to a large conference-sized table, to window counter seats. It's bright and airy, and has a really cool full-wall bookshelf filled with beautiful little trinkets. Seriously, this place is gorgeous. And then, the food! I've had the butter croissant and a latte each time I've been (what can I say, I'm a creature of habit) and they are both INCREDIBLE. So, so good. I can't say enough about them. Also, the service is super friendly and fast! Honestly, this is by far & away my favorite coffee shop in Seattle, whether it's to meet friends to chat, or to do work (note: they don't have outlets. So make sure your computer is fully charged beforehand!). Love, love, LOVE Celine!"
Gus S.,"Seattle, WA",5,3/3/2019,"5 star for the super friendly service and the excellent baked goods. There are a few other coffee shops and bakeries within a short distance on Phinney Ridge, but Alex and Daniela did a great job creating a warmer and more welcoming atmosphere than the competitors, and for that alone we are repeat customers.The coffee is good, all the pastries are super delicious, and we always end up ordering more than what the doctors recommend :). Alex and Daniela also keep experimenting with new additions to their menu, so there is always a new specialty to look forward to! We love Cafe Celine and love having it in our community."
Elena H.,"Seattle, WA",4,3/8/2019,"This is one of the best place for pastries, loved the tart, pie, croissants. Everything they had was really delicious. This is one of the best place for baked goods. The prices are tad high over here other than that it really is amazing. I am pleased with the place."
Meg C.,"Seattle, WA",4,12/18/2019,"Delicious croissants in a cute space. Only bummer is my quiche Lorraine was a bit on the dry side, but I'll be back for pastries!"
Maria F.,"Seattle, WA",3,11/24/2019,"Great food, awful service. Long line because only one barista and all the other staff was behind baking. 15 mins to get a coffee after getting my croissant."
Xuaner Z.,"Emeryville, CA",5,7/30/2017,"Yelp sent me a recommendation for this place, so I came. I came in a group of three, so that we could try (share) different croissants! We had the Nutella, the original butter and the cheese danish. I love the original butter croissant since it's especially crispy! And we actually got the one that just came out fresh :)The cappuccino Viennese was great and unique, with whipped cream and a dash of coca powder. I also got the macchiato, with your choice of the amount of frothed milk. I just had a little.I also enjoy the wall decoration on one side of the store, with teapots, flowers and vases."
Marie B.,"Shoreline, WA",5,7/16/2017,"Figures just as my physician tells me to cut back on mochas and baked goods, a trio of fellow Yelpers wrote about Celine Patisserie in Seattle's Phinney Ridge. Owner told me they've been open since third week of June. 'Quoi?' If it wasn't for that trio, I'd be late to the party and just whiz by along the main thoroughfare.That's enough for this Francophile to amend her schedule on Sunday morning (7/16/17) and drive 'tout suite' to check it out. Lucked out with a parking spot right by the bus stop out front. I don't miss the former business, Picnic...one of the rare times me and my son (a toddler at the time) were totally ignored. Complete opposite at Celine Patisserie, one is warmly greeted. Lovely interior with a focal wall with lots of plants, including orchids. Live plants and culinary art prints/photos round up the decor.Assorted seating available with some outdoor sidewalk seating, indoor tables and bright sunlit counter. The latter is best for people/canine watching as the there is brisk neighborhood pedestrian traffic.Nice eclectic music and no outlets visible....sorry laptop campers. Here contemplation and conversation are highly encouraged.Surprisingly arriving before 9am, the case was looking sparse. They are probably figuring out par levels and baking in small batches from their open air kitchen to keep it fresh. It smelled *HEAVENLY* during the 75 minutes I've been sitting at the counter writing this post. Eventually the baking/owner couple will have to hire a barista and baking assistants as business continues to ramp up.I briefly glanced at their dessert case, but focused on their baked goods. I bought one of each to sample and later to share with the sleeping family members. Purchased and sampled bites of a classic croissant (nice burnish and lamination), another (thought it was a pain au chocolat), but it was bear claw cut filled with Nutella (nearly ate all of it!), cream cheese danish topped with berries, bacon tomato basil galette, ham and cheese, and onion cheese. 'Tous sont delicieux!'Coffee is from Illy...yay! Only place I have Illy on a regular basis is a European cafe by a Lynnwood Park and Ride. Who knew, right? My 8 ounce mocha was given choices (type of milk and sweetened or unsweetened whipped cream). It was a strong foil to my pastry sampling.In a nutshell, pastries are baked just right. Flavors are thankfully not cloying, but inventive that let the fresh ingredients stand on its own.Plus with slighly lower prices than most other spots featuring baked goods, that's a major bonus for all parties.Seattle is truly blessed with so many independent cafes/bake shops in several neighborhoods. Celine Patisserie is worth a visit!"
Donna W.,"Puyallup, WA",5,2/17/2019,"Quaint little spot, delicious eats but even more the coffee/latte was the best I've ever had. I loved it so much I had to take a cup to go."
Valentina N.,"Victory Heights, Seattle, WA",5,9/14/2019,"It's been a month or so since we first found Celine Patisserie, and we've been back for breakfast at least 7 times. We're in love! We've tried most everything on the menu and it's all been perfect. Quality is always superb. It's obviously good when customers place their order, finish their meal, then order something else for the road! New employees are also very nice and considerate. The shop is always clean, cozy.... I can't gush enough. Come and visit!"
stephanie x.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,2/19/2019,I just love coming in and finding out what flavor of croissants they are baking that day!The owners are nice people and there is plenty of space inside to meet friends or clients. It seems to fly under the radar a bit in that it's not usually too busy. I definitely recommend it for pastries.
Machiko S.,"Seattle, WA",5,11/4/2018,"I had their savory galette and flaky cup filled with raspberry jam and mascapone. Both of them has the right amount of flavor (not too much, not too little, just right). But it's the texture of their pastries that is so good. What's also great is they are bicyclist-friendly :-D. You get 10% off if you ride there. Of course without the discount, I'll still go there!"
Amy N.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/11/2019,I love taking the family here for morning coffee and pastries. We love the cruffins and almond croissant.
John G.,"Seattle, WA",5,1/10/2020,"I take these yelp stars literally - three stars is a-ok, which in my mind is not bad at all (and I go to and love going to three star places all the time). Five is ""as good as it gets"", which is what Celine is.  The baked goods here are on par with anything I had in Paris, and I think are a half notch better than Besalu or Le Panier in Pike Place.  By my palate this is perfection.  The place is cute too.  Coffee is solid, much better than the dark Besalu coffee of yore (prior to Herkimer purchase)."
Ann V.,"Seattle, WA",4,4/10/2018,"This cute French bakery and cafe is owned by super friendly and accommodating owners, who are originally from France (as I assume per their French accents)! I recently traveled to Europe, and cannot say enough about the espressos overseas! Nothing compares in the States, so I was super happy to find a local Seattle cafe that has espressos from illy brand! This cafe is located in Phinney Ridge area, close to Red Mill Burgers, on Greenwood Ave. Free street parking is available and relative easy to find. There's outdoor seating available for warm summer days, and inside, there's plenty of seating next to front counter and toward window seating. Their menu selection is a combination of single-shot / double-shot espressos (yes, European style), cappuccinos, mochas, lattes, iced coffees, etc., along with baked goods and pastries. I ordered a double espresso and a warm-toasted almond croissant, which were both tasty and delicious! Definitely recommend to Seattle folks curious about a European cafe experience!"
Yuliya M.,"Auburn, WA",5,9/26/2019,Amazing cafe and homey atmosphere. Try goat cheese quiche - absolutely in love with! Other pastries are fantastic!
Magdalena K.,"Tacoma, WA",4,4/1/2018,"This cute cafe really feels like you are in Europe! I love it! Everything from staff with an accent, delicious pastries array, coffee served in cute Pedro Almodovar cups and a community feel.. Sadly when I got there around 11 on an Easter Sunday there was not much left in their pastry case, except for croissants. I had my eyes set on one of the danishes I saw on yelp and took a bus here all the way from Capitol Hill just for them.Nevertheless the croissant was tasty and not too sweet and the coffee was ok! What will make me want to come back is the euro ambiance and plenty of places to sit, no matter if you have company or not. I really enjoyed my time here sitting at the counter table and looking out the street. Also I really need to sink my teeth in that danish!"
JB B.,"Everett, WA",5,9/17/2019,"Oh man, the monkey bread roll was fabulous A bit of caramelly goo on the bottom Lots of butter Love this place !!"
Autumn D.,"Seattle, WA",5,2/19/2020,"This place is so cute and the pastries are as tasty as they are pretty! The atmosphere was very nice as well, and the staff was friendly. A+ all around!"
Ho-On Y.,"Seattle, WA",5,11/30/2018,"The best bakery I've been to. From their quiches to their cakes, everything was so good. Their croissant - namely the Kouign Amann - is so delicious. I cannot resist getting it every time. They have an amazing americano as well. The staff there are so friendly and they even gave us some leftover croissants when we were leaving as they closed!"
L A.,"Snohomish, WA",2,9/28/2019,"Nothing bad, but nothing good. Macchiato I ordered, turned out to be a tiny latte, did not serve club soda with it. Tried to sell me lemon Perrier. Bacon Gallete was good but very small and over priced."
Girlgeek B.,"Redmond, WA",5,2/23/2020,"Lovely bakery, love the galettes, great place for breakfast date. Nice team serving as well. Lemon berry galette was awesome"
Vanessa C.,"Wallingford, Seattle, WA",4,9/1/2019,I loved the bacon and egg gallete! It was super flaky and delicious. However the other 2 items we ordered were not as good. The plain croissant had no flavor at all and the color was very dark. The chocolate croissant was just okay and it didn't really stand out.
Elena F.,"Anchorage, AK",5,2/23/2018,"I stumbled upon this french bakery/cafe while exploring the Greenwood area of Seattle. They're the best bakery in Seattle, in my humble opinion, and very affordable for the excellent quality of product. Celine's french macrons are the best and certainly the most flavorful that I've tried from any business in the United States that sells french macrons. Their pricing is excellent! They charge $1.95 plus tax per macron, and have a pile of 'Imperfect Macrons' that are $1 each. Anywhere else, macrons would run you about $2.50 each. I am grateful that their macrons are a wonderful price! I am also grateful that I've possibly found a new regular spot to do my work on my laptop. The staff here are friendly and very kind. The service is also fast and consistent. I look forward to getting to know them! I've never been to France in this life time, but I'm super certain that Celine's has authentic french baked goods."
Sherrie T.,"Bellevue, WA",5,11/2/2018,"Visited here thanks to fellow Yelpers and thought Celine Patisserie had some fun spins on traditional bakery items.  Since I had guest in town, I got a variety of sweet and savory pastries to try. And guess what? We enjoyed them all! Only downside, I was like a kid in a candy shop ordering and then eating everyting that I don't remember what each item was called. All I remember is how much I loved the sugary/caramalized version of a circular croissant (which the cashier recommended)! Also, there was a mistake with my order, probably since my order was so big and I am sure I was rambling on since I was so excited. But what impressed me the most is how the barista and cashier quickly fixed, apologized for the mistake and refunded the extra drink. They genuinely felt bad and wanted to make it right which made me feel that I was valued customer. If you haven't been here you are missing out and every calorie is worth it. Just glad this place is a bit of a drive for me otherwise I would be there all the time."
Liz S.,"Seattle, WA",5,12/30/2018,"I've been here about 10 times, and they consistently have the best pastries and best service. The owners are very kind and attentive. In addition, the chai is really delicious, spicy and sweet and something different from the typical Oregon or Morning Glory. Get here early in the morning to make sure you get your pick. I've enjoyed their sweet pastries (particularly the kouign amann, danish and almond croissant), though the savory are good too."
L H.,"Seattle, WA",5,2/7/2020,Just the greatest place. We moved back to Seattle (from the burbs-DON'T MOVE TO THE BURBS) this summer and were thrilled to discover Celine in our neighborhood. incredible pastries and coffee. would go here every day if calories weren't a thing.
Kerry M.,"Atlanta, GA",5,6/8/2019,"Truly as good or better than a Parisian Patisserie.  This place really evokes memories of falling in love on the streets of Paris with my first/only/amazing wife.  A clear passion for making sure everything exceeds expectations.  Alex made three SUBLIME  coffee beverages for us.  He went out of his way to make our beverages exactly as we wished. Cheers!  Well worth your patronage.   Will hopefully return, even though we only have 100 hours in Seattle on this trip."
A. F.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/9/2019,"My husband is French, and he is VERY particular about his baked goods. When he ate the Celine pastries, he said, ""Hm, that's good."" And a few bites later, ""Actually, it's very good!"" Enthusiasm from a French person is rare praise indeed!Delicious sweets and savory pastries here. Stock up for your next brunch party and everybody will thank you."
Shanzi R.,"Seattle, WA",4,6/27/2019,"Wow, beautiful pastries and helpful employees. Nice outdoor patio to enjoy when the weather permits. If there is a special, GET it!"
Chenchen Y.,"Seattle, WA",5,6/30/2019,"Went there for the pistachio croissant, unfortunately it was sold out. Had the chocolate hazelnut and earl grey croissant instead. They were great. Especially the earl grey was so refreshing!"
Daniel A.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,6/22/2019,"Best croissant I've had thus far in Seattle. I had the chocolate croissant and an oat milk Mocha, which were delicious. Love the decor (plant heavy) and atmosphere. The service was good, the staff friendly, and when they accidentally made the wrong drink, they caught it before it even got to me, and remade the drink and served me both in case I wanted it. It's in a nice very walkable neighborhood, and parking was easy to find, even on a busy Saturday."
Megan R.,"Happy Valley, Bellingham, WA",5,7/20/2019,"The earl grey cream filled croissant solved all the problems in my life. Kidding, but only a little bit. Seriously, any treat here is going to be phenomenal and the space is so nice!"
Pranav K.,"Seattle, WA",5,4/28/2019,"My goodness! I dint know if cafe umbria could be topped, but this place serves a killer marrachino, made personally by the owner, who knows his stuff! It's no longer on the menu, so perhaps just request nicely.  we had the sausage egg gallette, which was scrumptious and flavored well. The sausage could easily be served on the side and I would order it!! Like again and again. the ham croissant sandwich, the Danish creme brulee and the pistachio croissant were all good. All in all we went another round of marrachino to finish our meal"
Renee M.,"McAllen, TX",5,8/1/2019,"Great find! Quiet place for breakfast, lots of seating. The pastries were delicious. My latte was made to perfection. I highly recommend their danishes as well."
Natalie S.,"Seattle, WA",5,4/6/2019,The best pastries I have found in Seattle! I tried the pistachio croissant paired with a mocha and was quite impressed with the flavor and texture! The staff were very friendly and accommodating as well. I will definitely be back!
Tyra W.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",5,1/26/2018,Awesome Macaroon and Croissant as everyone said!! The owner is a nice French couple and just moved here for one year. Definitely gonna try their fresh bakeries and pastries. You will NOT regret!!
Jorge P.,"Mercer Island, WA",5,11/21/2018,"I love Celine and always drive there when I get the chance. The food is delicious, the coffee is really food, but what is best is how friendly the couple that work there are. Last time I was there, me and my friends got carried away passed the closing time, and they just let us stay there!This place is definitely within my top 10 overall in Seattle and top 1 when I want to get a coffee or have a sweet tooth."
Amanda C.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/17/2018,"Came here for the fruit tarts, ended up working a few hours and staying till close. There aren't many outlets, so some charged. Great little place to relax, read a book, hang out. The pastries are kind of pricey ($5-6 each) but it's all high quality stuff I would pay for again! Also because we were the last to leave, the owners gave us a box of breakfast pastries to take home! So sweet of them!"
Mira K.,"Seattle, WA",5,11/14/2018,Just go there! You will never regret this visit.  European bakeries are the best!!They make nutella croissants that melts your heart not only your tongue.
Aslan C.,"Seattle, WA",5,5/8/2019,"We were on our way to the park and decided to stop by based on great reviews that I saw on Yelp. The place is pretty small but also have an outside seating area which is nice if you have a dog. Anyways, we tried a few different pastries and thought they were all fresh and tasty."
Diego G.,"Issaquah, WA",5,5/26/2019,"Incredible pastries.  Relaxing, quiet, clean atmosphere and a friendly staff.  Wow, we drove here from downtown and it was a bit of a gamble but it paid off!  Had a vanilla bean custard pastry and I think I died and went to heaven while eating it."
Rob F.,"Seattle, WA",5,4/25/2019,All the pastries I've tried are amazing and coffee is delicious. The quiche is my goto weekend brunch. The sandwiches are also delicious. Alex and co are very friendly and welcoming.
Zhe L.,"Ithaca, NY",1,11/3/2019,5 stars for food/drink. 1 star for WiFi which didn't let me connect to certain websites like github. Won't come again.
Cookie M.,"Mesa, AZ",5,6/12/2019,Great bakery!! I love their macarons. Very French :) and ice cream they use is a delicious local brand :)
Brian C.,"Seattle, WA",5,10/18/2018,"I've travelled to Paris and some other cities in Europe and have to say the pastries here rival the ones found in many pastry shops across Europe. This is my favorite place to get pastries in Seattle. Here's why: There's never a long line when I go. The charming couple who own and run the place,  Daniela and Alexei (Alex) enjoy serving their customers. The pastries have the right amount of balance of soft and crispy with top notch ingredients. The two pastries I am really enjoying at the moment are the heavenly Raspberry Mascarpone Cruffin (croissant muffin) and the Swedish Croissant Roll that has cinnamon and sugar in it. I haven't had their espresso drinks yet but since they have a nice espresso machine, use Caffe Umbria coffee beans, and lived in Italy for a while, I'm sure it's good. Hope this place stays around for a long time!"
Candice C.,"Kirkland, WA",5,7/11/2018,If you've seen any of my other reviews you know your girl is always down for dessert. This place is a sugar laced carb mecca and I will definitely be back.I decided to order my sis her birthday cake from this bakery after seeing some of the mirror glazed entremets pop up on my Insta a few times. They looked so cool and the flavor combos were way more sophisticated than the usual sheet cake (ain't nothin wrong with a supermarket sheet cake when you're 8 but in your thirties you gotta upgrade).Ordering was smooth and the cake was ready on time. It did have a decorating flaw because the mirror glaze got too thick around the sides and bunched up which honestly wouldn't have bothered me that much but the owner insisted that she felt terrible it wasn't 100% so she gave me another backup cake. Like who does that? I got a bonus cake y'all! And it was gorgeous. Matte red with gold flake. Both of the cakes were boss and I would have been happy with either but the fact that the owner decided to really ensure my satisfaction by giving me a whole other cake? Five stars for sure.I bought a box of viennoiseries while I was there for the pickup (couldn't resist) and I'm sure they were fantastic but can't actually say at full certainty because they were gobbled up by the fam before the next mornings breakfast rolled around.
Vijay S.,"Seattle, WA",4,11/20/2017,"Cute bakery with friendly owners/operators We got a chai (awesome mix that they use for this - was tasty)and passion fruit tart (spot on).No complaints - loved it and will go back when in the neighborhood (may not really be a ""destination bakery"" but well worth it if you happen to be in that neck of the woods - skip the Starbucks and go here!)"
Anaher B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,3/30/2019,"Divine simply divine! Service was great. I purchased a chocolate mousse, feta and spinach galette (I hope I got that right), a creme brûlée danish and a medium mocha. All of it was just what I wanted today. Particularly their mocha isn't oozing with sugar and neither is their mousse; meaning they were perfectly sweetened. Glad I came in and would absolutely return again!"
Mazdak K.,"Irvine, CA",4,1/26/2019,"The pastries were delicious, and  were made meticulously. The  staff were friendly. Great place to have coffee and pastry on Saturday morning."
Caris C.,"Chicago, IL",5,5/31/2018,"Their pastries are to die for! This place deserves more than 5 stars! Stopped in one early afternoon on a weekday so the wait wasn't long and they had a great selection to choose from. I had a difficult time choosing between the chocolate almond croissant or the strawberry mascarpone croissant, so I went with both! Both were so finger lickin' delicious that I was disappointed that I only ordered two. Too bad I was long gone when I ate these bad boys because I would have ran back in to order more.... a lot more. This place ruined my diet and I ain't complainin' If you're in the area looking for some sweet treats, this is the spot to check out! Don't be a fool like me and only order two things, order more!"
Johannes B.,"Port Townsend, WA",5,1/24/2019,"Man, you Seattle people are so lucky to have so many amazing bakeries.  I am super jealous!  This patisserie is exquisite!  The cruffin (croissant/ muffin). Is a giant flaky treat that is hard to get your mouth around in a good way.  The savory gallettes with the egg in the middle are the bomb!  I want to go back and try the quiches!"
Tammie E.,"Seattle, WA",4,6/26/2018,"Pastries are 8 stars, they're so good! Coffee is 1 star, not very flavorful or strong. Service is really good. They used to wholesale at my favorite coffeeshop (Cracken, if you haven't been, do yourself a favor and go, it's worth the trek up north), but no more unfortunately. It was a great way to get their delish baked goods to a wider audience, but understand it can be hard to keep up. Anyway, if you're near greenlake & craving the best pastries then look no further."
David P.,"Miami, FL",5,10/8/2017,Great new pastry shop in a convenient location.  The shop is spacious and there's a variety of pastries.  The galette is delicious and the macaroons are very good.  Staff is very friendly.  Definitely worth stopping in as one of the best in Seattle.
Bubba S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",5,9/21/2018,"Found this gem on Yelp and it lived up to its 5 star rating. Croissants were super light and flakey, not excessively sweet and had good flavor, as good as any I've had in Paris. Mocha and chai tea lattes were tasty with good balance of taste and sweetness. Good casual place for a coffee and pastry snack in a coffee bar atmosphere. I would return...probably tomorrow."
Stacy V.,"Seattle, WA",5,4/30/2019,"Their almond croissant is the best I think I have ever had. Flakey crust layers forever!! Superb and rich almond flavor.Their coffee is good, but was not served very hot. You might want to specify super hot if that is your taste."
Jamie S.,"Seattle, WA",5,1/28/2019,"DELICIOUS!!! The spinach feta galette was great! The pastry was buttery and flaky and the filling was like Spanakopita. The fruit custard one wasn't as flaky as the spinach one but the custard was light and perfectly sweet. It tasted homemade, and the fruit added a little tartness. I love that it tastes high quality and isn't really sweet. The almond croissant is pretty large. It almost tasted like a biscotti. I have had a lot of almond croissants and this one was definitely top 2."
Sandi C.,"Redmond, WA",5,3/9/2019,"This is the BEST bakery in the entire Seattle area.  There is only 1 reason why this has 5 stars -- it is that good.    If you like yummy baked goods, you will love this place.  I had a raspberry  cruffin, coconut cream croissant, and a few other tasty treats.  LOVED EVERYTHING!!"
Manka V.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/29/2019,"Celine is just what Seattle needed in terms of croissants and pastries. Flaky crusts, textured dough, deliciousness and gorgeous presentation. I con every weekend to get croissants for my family. They love the plain, almond, Nutella, ham and cheese and berries and lemon custard ones. But they all seem fantastic!"
Dandelion F.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/5/2019,"Oh my... the cruffin. The cruffin with mascarpone and raspberry filling. I had thought nothing could wean me off of traditional croissants, but the cruffins at Celine have done it. The mascarpone and raspberry are much better than the Boston cream. Hazelnut croissants are a close second for me. The owners are so kind, and the variety so enticing--there is no better start to a Saturday/Sunday than a treat here. For something less sweet, try the breakfast danish, with egg and bacon. Weekday selection is not as large, but still good. Bon appetit!!!"
April S.,"Issaquah, WA",3,9/6/2017,"Come here for the pastries, not the coffee. Very pleasant service and the pastries are delicious, but the coffee is subpar for Seattle standards."
Etienne L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,8/24/2018,"Great little patisserie to get Macaroons, croissants and great service. I got a variety of snack for a get together. The person that helped me took his time explained his background and his passion to make great croissants. The chocolate croissants and macaroons were the best to me. I would come back to come back to try other items as I was very happy with my purchases. Note: Street Parking available and I would recommend to come before noon for more options as it sell pretty fast."
C R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",5,5/28/2018,"What a find. Was visiting from CA and staying nearby and discovered this patisserie on Yelp. Pasteries looked extaordinaire, but I can only personally vouch for the croissants, which were heavenly.Serious French chic vibe. Eclectic mix of customers. I will certainly return every time I visit Seattle. May move here to be closer to Celine's."
Seth L.,"Seattle, WA",5,4/7/2018,"Everything we've tried have been delicious, whether savory or sweet. Light, flaky dough with well balanced and flavorful fillings or toppings. Many items are stables, but new flavors do also appear. Glad to see they're willing to experiment. The coffee is excellent, always well executed. The folks are always super friendly, they always make you feel welcomed. Good food. Good drinks. Good folks. Our favorite bakery."
Jessica W.,"Seattle, WA",4,10/15/2018,So glad Celine has moved into the neighborhood because they make amazing baked goods. I have become a fast addict of their 'cruffin' (croissant/muffin) but find that it isn't always available (hence the missing star) and when it is they alternate between the lovely marscapone/fruit filling to the too sweet chocolate/caramel filling. The people working there are also very sweet and accommodating. Highly recommend trying everything!
Matt K.,"Seattle, WA",4,7/14/2018,"Some of the best non-bakery Nouveau pastries here in Seattle. Major bonus points for not having the crazy bakery nouveau lines and being in my neighborhood! Their laminated dough is always crispy, flaky, and buttery! I usually go for the Savory items and they have a decent selection! Their passion fruit tart was top notch as well. I wish there were more plugs in the waiting room. Also - I wish the egg on the some of the savory danish/croissants wasn't as cooked - maybe that's the way it has to be though for prebaked pastries and health code?"
Jun W.,"Seattle, WA",5,11/19/2018,It's a surprise this patisserie didn't have a 15min line for their perfect croissants! Both the hazelnut croissant and bacon egg sandwich were delicious!
Amy N.,"San Marcos, CA",1,1/13/2019,"I left my wallet at this establishment, I called back later when I realized I had forgotten it. Whoever answered told me they found it and left it on their counter for anyone to pick up. Someone else had taken my wallet because their staff thought it would be best to leave it out on their counter. Now I'm cancelling all my cards and don't understand why they didn't hold onto my wallet like any other place would have. Or asked whoever took it to identify something out of it instead of letting them just take it."
Shiwen C.,"Fremont, CA",5,3/21/2018,"This is my go to bakery for any pastry and cakes. My boyfriend bought a raspberry entremet red glazed cake for my birthday and not only did this cake look amazing, it also tasted divine!I also highly recommend their macarons since they are as good if not better than the ones from Paris. When I'm feeling savory, I'll usually get a bacon galette or breakfast galette. You honestly cannot go wrong with anything this bakery produces.In terms of customer service, I would give Celine patisserie a Michelin rating. I recently bought a cake for my mom and came to pick it up. I noticed the cake didn't have ""happy birthday Mom"" as requested and mentioned it to the owner. He quickly admitted that he had forgotten and took it back to put the writing on it. He returned 5 minutes later to say that he didn't like the quality of the writing and wanted to take more time to make sure the work was up to their standard. He offered me complimentary delivery to my work in SLU and even provided me some macarons for the road. Although I was perfectly fine with just having the cake delivered to me, the owner was extremely kind to offer macarons. I have only experienced this service one other time through my food travels. I cannot explain how much these small business owners value customer experience. They will continue to have my business in the future and I will always order cakes from them."
Lindsey W.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/23/2018,"This is my favorite pastry shop in all of Washington. Surprisingly affordable prices for handmade, exceptionally delicious pastries. It's so conveniently located, and has a calm, pretty interior. Alex, the owner, has a fantastic personality and makes a real effort to get to know his customers. He had my name memorized by the third visit !This is a perfect spot to study, relax, snack, or even just drop in. I can't praise it highly enough."
Seema G.,"New York, NY",5,11/29/2018,"This is my favorite neighborhood coffee shop. The pastries are made in house and are really special (eg raspberry mascarpone cruffin, three berries and custard gallete, amazing almond croissants, tarts, and macarons). I also love their chai latte -- it's spicy and not too sweet. To top it off, the owners are there everyday, making the drinks and pastries themselves. They are really sweet. I highly suggest supporting this local business -- you won't regret it."
Shiyao W.,"Seattle, WA",5,6/24/2018,"This is my favorite bakery in Seattle. The food  are fresh and delicious, the people are really nice. And easy to find a street parking nearby. Everything here is super amazing. Highly recommend to everyone!!!!!!"
Devin B.,"Northwest Seattle, Seattle, WA",4,9/9/2019,"Delicious treats and above par service. In my experience, employees are generous, helpful, and warm. My only bit of feedback would be to update the interior and at times the cafe gets humid and some of the pastries (like the kouign amann) get kind of chewy toward the second half of the day."
Yanlin P.,"Redmond, WA",5,6/10/2018,"I know this store after eating their bread in a coffee shop in Everett. I was so impressed by the bread so decided to visit their store the next day. I was not disappointed, their bakery is so far in the best that I had in Seattle area. My favorite is the breakfast galette, flaky, appropriately salted, yammy! Will definitely visit again and recommend to anyone."
Ai M.,"Kirkland, WA",5,3/16/2018,Pastries taste great!! Croissant was very flaky and perfect size. I wanted to eat everything. Definitely I will go back to try them all. Also the owners were so friendly and very helpful. There was a baby who kept coughing and the owner asked mom if he can bring a water for the baby. They work hard for customers. I highly recommend this place!
Keren V.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/23/2019,Great cafe!!! Got the mocha and Nutella croissant. Not too busy on a Wednesday afternoon and the prices were reasonable.
Hannah B.,"New Plymouth, OH",5,7/28/2019,"Everything we had here was absolutely delicious. The cruffin with raspberry and mascarpone was my personal favorite, but all the pastries we tried were decadent and truly special. The creme brûlée pastry was also one of the best pastries I've ever had. If I lived in Seattle I would come here weekly."
Lauren L.,"Seattle, WA",5,12/13/2017,"Great patisserie!  Update 9/2018.  I had ham and brie on a croissant today that was sublime.  Hand cut ham with luscious brie on the flakiest croissant with homemade aoili and baby lettuce.  This bakery knows what they are doing, and does it perfectly.  Their ""mini"" quiches, which I have tried in 2 flavors (broccoli/cheddar, and the traditional ""Lorraine""), are light and fluffy, and the crust so buttery and delicious!One of my absolute favorites is their ""Gallette"" with goat cheese/baby grape tomatoes, and shredded basil. This is strewn with pumpkin seeds and the surrounding pastry is sprinkled with sesame seeds.  GOD THEIR PASTRY IS AMAZING!  So many beautiful textures and flavors:  the absolutely delicious, flakey pastry is a delight, the crunch of the sesame seeds and the pumpkin seeds, the smooth/tangy flavors of the goat cheese and tomato..... Its true one is filling enough for me, but I just want to keep eating its so marvelous!  Their ""breakfast"" Gallette is a larger version and contains an over-easy/medium egg with other various toppings such as bacon.  This also has the lovely sesame seeds.Their sweet confections look absolutely AMAZING and I'm sure they are.  I can't wait to try more of their gorgeous bounty!  Oh and they make REAL ""Macaron"".  So many places import them from France because, quite frankly, they can be difficult to make successfully.  Celine has the touch, however, and their Macaron are lovely.  I tried the Pistachio and it was subtle and melted in my mouth.Pastries are priced well for their quality and size.  Delicious coffee available. Although there are several bakeries on Phinney/Greenwood, this is my absolute favorite! Very cordial owners, friendly service and pleasant atmosphere!"
Sage B.,"Green Lake, Seattle, WA",4,8/12/2018,"A cute spot on the main stretch of Phinney! I went out for a quick breakfast bite with my mother and we found it to be very authentically French! I had a latte and a broccoli cheddar quiche. My latte was tasty and the quiche was good, but I prefer a thicker more Americanized quiche. Then again it's a FRENCH bakery so I'd say it was very good. On the other hand my mother had one of the most delicious crepes I'd ever tasted and I had to fight her to even get a bite. It was decadent- chocolatey and nutty and perfectly flakey. She also had a Viennese (basically a cafe au lait with whipped cream and cinnamon!) that was delightful. The outdoor seating is alright and the service was friendly. It was an all around pleasant experience."
Rachael T.,"Seattle, WA",5,3/30/2018,"Friendly service. Clean cafeTheir croissants are bomb dot com! Way better than the ones I've had at Dahlia Bakery. The baked goods are freah,. Baked daily in the kitchen. You get to see the pastry chef working too. They offer to heat up your croissants, which is such a bonus. You will not regret buying a few things from them."
Ballardite A.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/15/2018,"Not often do I write a review or give five stars.  Please do not come here as I love the relaxing atmosphere.  But...  this place is spot on.  Ambiance, food, service all great.  Well done, cheers!"
Josh P.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,9/22/2018,"Wow. Wow. Wow. This place is simply the best. It's not just a fabulous coffee shop with incredible baked goods; it's a ""home away from home,"" where you're always treated like family. If you're reading this review, stop reading and get to Celine. Proof is in the ""pudding."""
Nikki C.,"Seattle, WA",3,12/22/2017,The chocolate covered croissant was my favorite. I like the service and the cafe. The cafe was nice and clean and well put together. I went with a few of my friends and tried a lot of their menu items. The only thing that was unfortunate was that there was no dairy free options so my friend couldn't eat anything:( I got a london fog as my beverage and it was okay. It was more on the watery side and less sweet which was not something I really enjoyed but I kept stealing my friends cremè brûlée and tart which were sweet and delicious.
Ivonne D.,"Snohomish, WA",5,6/16/2019,Great desserts and really good coffee! Excellent pastries!  I hope to come back soon and keep trying new things!
Maelani Q.,"Seattle, WA",5,11/25/2018,"This is the only place I'll get my pastries and I live up north in Lynnwood so yeah I'll make that drive, my family is obsessed with how flaky and buttery the pastries are, every one of them. It's so yummy it's a new Addiction."
Makana K.,"Everett, WA",5,11/13/2018,"I'm a fan of this place as they have awesome croissants and desserts. My first taste was of a cake my supervisor purchased for a retirement party at work. Then while the inlaws were in town I dropped by to pick up some croissants, cruffins, etc. Those were a hit so decided to also put in an order for my wife's birthday cake a few days ago. It's the two of us and my little girl and we've been devouring the cake it's that good.What tops it off for me are the owners. As others have mentioned they are really nice. Alexei even called to confirm I would be there to pick up my wife's cake on the day I said I would as I was a few hours late and they were nearing closing time. He even came out to shake my hand which is awesome and speaks to the type of person he is.Celine Patisserie has earned my business.I think you should give them a try...you won't be disappointed."
linda a.,"Pacifica, CA",5,8/8/2018,"OMG- just go there. Rivals or beats Tartine and Fournee. Everything is delicious, but their flaky pastry is unbelievable. Next best thing to paris."
Michelle P.,"Holbrook, MA",5,5/9/2019,"Loved it! Came here for breakfast while visiting Seattle for the first time with my girlfriend. Delicious pastries, good coffee, and friendly and efficient staff. What more could you ask for from a neighborhood cafe?? A++"
E M.,"Seattle, WA",5,10/18/2018,"Great service, friendly people, clean and their pastries are AMAZINGLY great.  Our favorite place to stop by after school."
Vero V.,"San Jose, CA",5,2/17/2019,Had two of the pastries and a capuchino. Loved them both. Coffee was great. Tasted their quiche which my daughter ordered and was delicious. I Recommend this place.
Audrey P.,"Seattle, WA",5,5/8/2018,Very very good croissants and pains au chocolate (the actual French name for chocolate croissant). The staff was super super friendly! Their quiche is also DELICIOUS!
Susan M.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/29/2017,"So good. I've never seen breakfast galettes (or bacon galettes) like these anywhere else and they are a perfect small savory breakfast. So is the quiche, which is lighter and more of a pastry than any other I've had. I also love the fruit galettes and everything else I've tried. It's completely fine to go in here barefoot if you want to. No one's ever mentioned a word about it. Honestly, that's the case almost everywhere, but some reason, a lot people believe the myth that you must wear shoes in food establishments, so I'm doing my best to spread accurate information about that."
Tom M.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/10/2017,"Pretty rare that I have time to repeat visit a new spot what with all the new stuff opening around town, but I have spent much of the last three weekends at Celine noshing and introducing my peeps to Seattle's newest and prospective candidate for best bakery. (Much more onsite research will need to be undertaken before I can commit to that statement.)Other Yelpers have more than adequately detailed the stars of the show - the pastries - so I will only say that my personal favorites are...every single item I have ordered.  The owners are friends whose life journey started in their homeland of Moldova, and wound through Italy, France, California and finally Seattle. Along the way, not only did they learn the art of baking, but also how to warmly welcome their customers and pull a great latte (not sure how anyone could diss Illy coffee - stick to your Folgers).  Not sure what is leading so many fine bakers to cluster along the Greenwood-Phinney corridor, but Celine joins some pretty illustrious company in that neighborhood and more than holds their own.  Speaking of which, why am I typing when I could be chowing down?"
Megan E.,"Seattle, WA",5,6/1/2019,Our absolute FAVORITE neighborhood cafe. The food is truly delicious and great coffee. Extremely reasonable prices!! We love Celine Patisserie!!!
Ben A.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/17/2017,"Add me to the list of 5-star reviews.  The delicious food reminds me of casual patisseries in Europe, and the people here are great.A quick note on the coffee: I make slow-pour coffee at home with beans from Heart, Blue Bottle, and Counter Culture.  The Illy coffee served at Celine Patisserie is delicious.  It's strong and rich, just like you'll find at casual espresso bars in Italy.  I don't know why someone wouldn't like the coffee here.  Also, it's an open and inviting space, and very family friendly.  My 3-yr. old son wanted me to pick him up to watch the proprietor making coffee, and he kindly offered my son a small hot chocolate or steamed milk.  We're adding Celine Patisserie to our go-to list for the Phinney neighborhood."
ParisAnne D.,"Kirkland, WA",5,8/15/2017,"Yum! I had the feta onion croissant and monkey bread. Would love to try more things, almond croissants always call my name. At 9:30 am quite a few things were already gone, so go early."
Jen R.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/31/2017,They've ruined other coffee and pastry shops for me. The food is baked on-site and is just incredible. My favorites are the goat cheese galette and the Nutella croissant. The owners are sweet and helpful and the coffee is better and less expensive than most places on the ridge. I love this place so much.
Erin D.,"King, WA",5,11/10/2017,Pastries are delicious and bargain-priced!The coffee was also perfect and the atmosphere and music were too.Best pear galette and I love that the Danish has lemon cream...just so yummy! Can't wait to go back and try some of the savory treats. The prices are so fair that you could take a box home to share. Great service. Please patronize and tell your friends so that this little gem succeeds :)
Richard S.,"Burlingame, CA",5,1/23/2019,"Most people think of the delicious sweets, but for me, Celine's savory pastry is to die for. The egg and bacon galettes have the perfect mix of flaky crust and delicious bacon (thick country cut), then they are topped with a sprinkle of sesame seeds, something that adds enormously to the delight."
Paavni R.,"Seattle, WA",5,10/7/2017,"What a good find! Many options for coffee, and both sweet and savory baked goods. We got the croissant, galette and the quiche. They have plentiful seating available. The staff is nice, and the decor is pretty. Overall a quaint European style bakery."
Yimin Angela C.,"Lynnwood, WA",5,4/26/2019,"stopped by this place on a whim the other day and had to come back for more. you've gotta try their raspberry mascarpone cruffin.then my friends brought me here for my birthday and they truly made it a special day. the owner personally wished me happy birthday and had me try their chocolate brioche, which was also absolutely fabulous. she is absolutely darling.if you love chocolate mousse, my cake is that of a cold at first creamy delicious melt in the mouth decadent chocolate truffle experience bite after bite - highly recommend the raspberry chocolate mousse cake  thank you so much!"
E M.,"La Palma, CA",5,8/3/2018,"Celine was recommended by a passenger seated next to me on a flight to Seattle. The next morning went directly to Celine just before opening and my party was first in line.  We ordered about $125 worth of assorted pastries.  Alex was very helpful in gathering our order and describing what we ordered. I believe we got the following... regular croissant, chocolate and hazelnut croissant,  maple croissant,  peach almond danish,  pistachio raspberry danish and kouign ammann. Everything was wonderful,  the croissants were flaky and crisp and the flavored ones were not too sweet. But,  we didn't get to taste the kouign ammann because I think since the order was so large we forgot to check the order properly.  Anyhow, everything were did have was great.  Thank you, Alex. We'll see you next time!"
J. K.,"Seattle, WA",5,10/5/2018,"Delightful patisserie! Great tasting barista drinks to go with wonderful assortment of superb pastries! No sweet tooth?! There are equally delicious savory offerings; quiche Lorraine, croissant sandwiches and their famous galettes! They have two galettes; an egg bacon and an egg vegetable."
Jason M.,"Seattle, WA",5,10/14/2018,"Great food, great people. Small neighborhood shop with good attention to detail. The owners seem genuinely invested in creating a welcoming environment and serving high quality baked goods. Don't leave without tasting the croissants!"
Kara R.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/19/2017,Everything is beautiful here. It's nearly impossible to choose. My breakfast galette was one of the most delicious things I've ever had. Simple perfection. The staff is friendly and focused on customer service. Plenty of free street parking on a Saturday at 10am. Bright and spacious cafe setting. This won't be a hidden gem for long.
Catherine C.,"Seattle, WA",4,11/10/2017,Celine's food offerings are extensive and you can taste the quality of the pastries.The European vibe is very much alive in this gem of a patisserie in the Phinney neighborhood.Support a local business!
Cynthia M.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/6/2017,"Beautiful attention to detail to the coffee and presentation of our pastries. Quiet, quaint and clean. I will return again and again."
Mary J.,"Seattle, WA",5,11/26/2017,"Was at Celine in my way to university. I wish there was a higher rate than 5* so I could rate them.Had the best croissant ever, better the ones I had in France(and I've been to some of the best there). Everything looks so good, will have to try all one by one.The latte is amazing as well.Plus, as a bonus I saw the most handsome baker ever and what a cute accent!. I think I'm not the only woman melting in front of a sexy man with a full tray of hot croissants . Can I have them for take away please?"
Uncle Wiggley 1.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/28/2017,"Been going back and you know this is good.  I took a good camera and had fun taking pictures, hope you like them.  I keep trying different things and each one is a winner.  They have an electric waste can in the bathroom that is fun also.  The cookie with honey is very rich and I loved the butter cookie, it reminds me of my grandmother.  These guys are the Formula 1 winners in pastries."
Misha G.,"Seattle, WA",5,2/2/2018,"Did Ballard/ Phinney need another amazing European style pastry shop? Not necessarily. But after going in on the urging of a friend, I can tell you that this one might be the best. A wider selection than some of my other favorite places and everything I've tried has been excellent. Not to mention exceptional customer service. And open on Mondays and Tuesdays. Try Celine!!!"
Sara F.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/7/2018,Delicious Pastries and amazing coffee!  Celines is our go to for a wonderful treat. The staff are so friendly and kind!  This place is a must!
Briana M.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/4/2018,"So good.  Light, airy, impressively authentic pastries! Appreciated the mix of sweet and savory options."
Kirsten L.,"Carlsbad, CA",5,8/25/2017,"I ordered a medley of pastries for 80 people, and not only were the delicious and beautiful but warm and literally straight from the oven! Everyone at our meeting raved about the pastries. Thank you so much!!"
Meg J.,"Birmingham, AL",5,3/27/2018,"This is the BEST bakery of pastries we have found in Seattle. Seriously so good! Their attention to detail is so amazing, we got a box full of pastries and one of each of the macarons, everything so tasty! Will definitely be coming here a lot! Favorite was the frangipane, yum!"
Arna S.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/15/2018,"I wish I could give this place more than five stars. They make the best pastries we've had in Seattle. The doughs are flakey and flavorful. The selection magical. They make everything from scratch and cut no corners in their preparation, and you can tell with every bite. They have both savory and sweet pastries, and excellent coffee drinks.The space is also really nice, with lots of tables and chairs to sit and enjoy yourself. If anyone is looking for authentic European-style pastries, this is the place to go!"
Sarah A.,"Seattle, WA",5,5/19/2018,"Hands down the best bakery in Seattle! Everything you get here (and we've tried just about everything) is mouthwatering, fresh, light but deliciously satisfying. The way the blend the flavors together for some of their richer breakfast offerings are exquisite- I feel like I'm at a gourmet restaurant. The coffee is also a favorite of ours. The space itself is also very inviting with natural light and plenty of space. And last but not least, the owners Alex and Daniela are the most sweet and down to earth people you'll meet. It feels good to support such nice folks!"
Binit M.,"Bellevue, WA",5,2/17/2018,"Their Creme Brulee was to die for- the right amount of brittle on top and lightly spiced creamy underneath. We also tried the Marrocchino Caldo which if you love dark chocolate, would be the perfect top up after a meal."
Jyoti B.,"Seattle, WA",5,3/11/2018,"This place is such a gem! Every since my trip to Italy, switching back to Seattle bitter coffee was rough. I'm always on the lookout for a great European or Italian coffee shop. I just moved to the Fremont neighborhood, and was on a walk through the Phinney neighborhood with my partner, when we spotted this patisserie. I grabbed his arm excitedly, and the guy inside noticed and motioned us in. I decided to buy some coffee, and my partner said he didn't want anything, he gave us 2 pastries on the house! He was so friendly and customer-oriented. The coffee was AMAZING, and the pastries were too (we got the pistachio croissant, and the Nutella croissant). Will definitely be going back, they made a repeat customer for sure!!"
Tova S.,"New Orleans, LA",5,2/17/2018,"Best croissant I've had in a while! Super flaky and buttery, and warmed up it was perfect. Clearly very fresh too!"
Yvonne P.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/8/2018,"I loved this place already, and now they're making hearty croissant sandwiches! The owners here try to get to know their regulars, and they're always experimenting with new flavors. Their croissants are just perfect -- crispy on the outside and buttery and chewy on the inside. Go early for the best selection."
Chia-Ling T.,"Seattle, WA",5,5/30/2018,"Definitely our new favorite laminated dough place! Great texture, good flavors and friendly service. Although they could use another pair of helping hands, there is enough seating to wait around and let your expectation escalate, because you will not be disappointed!"
Anthony D.,"Redmond, WA",5,8/1/2017,"Went here last Friday with my lady and let me tell you something.. go Go GO! This place has a relaxing ambiance and their pastries were delicious! I got to meet a few of the owners (2 different families) and they were so kind and cool. This is a perfect place to take a lady on a date too! So fellas/ladies, do yourself a favor and impress somebody by taking them here! GO!"
Midori N.,"Bryant, Seattle, WA",5,11/17/2018,Amazing pastry. Friendly staff! Warm ambiance. Delicious coffee. Our new favorite coffee shop in Seattle.
Penny G.,"Seattle, WA",3,1/27/2018,"I really wanted this place to be awesome cause it's so close to my house. But after three visits, all before 9am, I've realized they just don't have a great selection. Yes, their food is good, but not a lot to choose from. Guess I'll keep making the slog to Byen Bakery in Queen Anne."
Adam B.,"Seattle, WA",5,11/16/2018,"Fresh hand-made pastries, friendly service, and a nice place to sit. What more could you want? This is where we go when we need to be cheered up in the morning."
Giancarlo L.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/8/2017,"We live just a couple blocks away and I was so excited to see a new cafe in the neighborhood. They use Illy products which are super high quality and European which is a nice change of pace. They have quite the setup for espresso and the owner Alexi knows how to pull a shot. I am no expert on French pastries, but the ham and cheese croissant was one of the best I have ever had. It was like an angel died in my mouth. The prices were also very reasonable and Alexi was super friendly. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
Tim H.,"Seattle, WA",5,11/9/2017,I love this bakery! First rate pastry and good coffee--it doesn't get much better than this.
Hillary M.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/5/2017,So glad they've taken over the old Picnic location. We had great pastries and coffees. Wonderful service and great assortment of treats. Nice seating and friendly owner. We'll definitely come back!
Mollie M.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/16/2017,"This place is brilliant!!  Authenticity that you can't find in most places.  It has delicious eats, both savory and sweet with the most wonderful Eastern European salt-of-the-earth owners/employees.  Coffee is so delicious and not bitter too!Everything is extremely fairly priced and its a great spot to work on your laptop."
Anne T.,"Seattle, WA",5,2/3/2018,Excellent authentic European style pastries and espresso. Friendly owners (originally from Moldova) who make everything on site. Charming atmosphere. Very warm and welcoming place. I'm impressed
Mandy K.,"Honolulu, HI",5,8/3/2017,"Cute, clean and spacious cafe. Love their butter croissants, will need to come back to try their other pastries."
Jacqueline S.,"Seattle, WA",5,4/7/2018,"Delicious pastries, perfectly made espresso, and a lovely light filled space. It was everything I was hoping for and I will definitely be back to try more pastries!!!"
Alison A.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/9/2017,I happened to stumble upon this neighborhood gem while walking around Phinney on a Sunday morning.  Their coffee (by Illy) is strong and their artisanal pastries are as beautiful as they are delicious!  The interior is tastefully designed and the owners welcomed us in with smiles.  This will definitely become a spot I frequent!
Jazmin H.,"Renton, WA",5,11/29/2017,Welcoming staff and great place to come in and relax or to grab a quick bite and enjoy a delicious pastry. Also a great place to study  and tables big enough for  a group of people or by yourself. Espresso is very tasteful and satisfying. I would definitely come back!
Katie T.,"Auburn, WA",5,2/22/2018,"My fellow diner and I found Celine Patisserie just before closing time.  The service was amazing, and we were given free macarons because it was our first time in the bakery.  My (free) mango macaron was large, beautiful, and delicious. Although the flavor was definitely fruity and tropical, I wouldn't have been able to identify it as mango.  I didn't mind though.  It was twice as big as the macarons we tried at another bakery, and, had we paid for it, half the price.  I was overjoyed to find kouign amann among the delicacies in the pastry counter.  Having never tried kouign amann, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I can truthfully say that this is the best kouign amann I have ever had. It was flaky, buttery, caramelized, and golden.  I absolutely loved it. I would definitely recommend Celine Patisserie."
Mariana P.,"Bothell, WA",5,2/19/2018,This is by far my favorite patisserie shop! Their bakings  are unique and so delicious! The croissants of any kind there are to die for! Also the crem brûlée and the macaroons are super yummy. The personnel is very lovely to chat with and very welcoming! I really love their Illy coffee as well! I also placed a customized order with Dana and she made it very authentic and exceeded my expectations.Awesome job!
Jeff C.,"Seattle, WA",5,2/13/2018,"Five stars does not do this bakery justice. It is a 10 - hands down. The ham & cheese croissant is exquisite and without question the best stateside croissant I've ever had. The croissant was buttery, flaky and perfectly sized. The smell upon entering this bakery is heavenly!Today, I brought in a selection of baked items to work from Celine and had some co-workers (serious food snobs) try it. The reaction each one had was the same...incredible.What a wonderful job the owners have done here. Cant wait to return!"
Stephen E.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/15/2018,What a wonderful place!  I am always looking for an excuse to get over here and have some yummy pastry and coffee. The owners are really nice as well.
Liz E.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/10/2017,"Neighborhood gem. Friendly service, great environment and best of all, phenomenal (strong) coffee! I go to Celine almost every morning, say hi to the owner and he asks if it will be the usual, and I take my americano to go;) love this place and love supporting local small business owners. Highly recommend!"
Ali R.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,8/16/2018,"Amazing French pastries, wonderful coffee, adorable cafe setting and super friendly staff. What a delightful addition to the neighborhood. I had the Nutella croissant, warmed, and an americano! So good!!! Flakey, buttery, not to sweet but perfect chocolate ratio. Coffee was smooth and delicious! Will definitely be back!"
JP L.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/4/2017,"The peach galette was delicate yet filling. The chocolate croissant was excellent. And the coffee was strong and made to order. Delightful, warm staff (may have been an owner who made and re-made my wife's coffee when she inadvertently ordered the wrong thing, and who didn't charge us for it) and delectable well-made pastries will bring us back again."
Nancy S.,"Seattle, WA",5,10/18/2017,"Their pastries are delicately crispy on the outside and perfectly moist within. Delicious! I bought both sweet and savory pastries for my book club meeting, and every piece was excellent. The two savory ones were feta cheese and ham/cheese. The sweet ones included pastries filled with dark chocolate, Nutella, Bavarian cream, and raspberry/lemon. The owners were friendly and helpful. I also got a latte which was a strong rich flavor."
Jacqueline N.,"Kirkland, WA",5,10/12/2017,"Here in Seattle there are many bakeries and coffee shops to enjoy delicious treats. I would say out of my 30 something years of living here, this is my favorite bakery.   What I love most is the amazing dessert and pastries that they have including macaroons and the most delicious almonds and chocolate croissants you'll ever taste. I just know that the food  is made with love and quality ingredients.  The coffee is great and I really enjoyed their hemp milk lattes. Thank you so much Celine for bringing such a Gem to Phinney"
Carlos R.,"Seattle, WA",5,11/22/2017,Very delicious pastries.  My dad and I loved the savory galettes. Will be going there for breakfast again.
Cita C.,"Seattle, WA",5,6/20/2018,"I love French pastries and I have been going to those bakeries listed on Yelp as the best for many years. They were good. Last Sunday, my son was searching for the best croissant in Seattle and Celine was the only one that we haven't tried. The place is a little bit hidden and you normally don't notice the sign when you're driving. We ordered almond croissant, passion fruit pastry and cappuccino. Oh boy! now I can say this is the best of the best.  Now I know where to go every Sunday for our breakfast treat. One stroke of luck, we live in Greenwood area."
Amy V.,"Berkeley, CA",5,11/8/2017,"The latte I had was Devine. It was so smooth and so good. I am a bit of coffee snob so this latte, was the best. Highly highly recommend the coffee. Oh, the pastries look beautiful and the smells. I can't wait to go back."
Lil Z.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/10/2018,Friendly staff and delicious pastries. I am particularly fond of the galettes - puff pastry with cheese or egg filling.  The croissants are perfect.
Jeanette C.,"Chehalis, WA",5,10/14/2017,This is a charming Bakery.  Customer service is outstanding. The almond croissant is the best I have ever had in my life.  Once you try this place you will be hooked just like I am.
Caroline J.,"Camarillo, CA",5,8/31/2017,I've only been here once but really enjoyed the cappuccino Viennese. The staff were all very nice and service was quick and efficient. I'll definitely be back to try their pastries!
Jiyoon J.,"Champaign, IL",5,8/4/2018,They always have new kinds of deserts. The owners are really nice . They not only make great pastries but also coffees. Nice and quiet table spots to do some work after recharching yourself with some sugar. Love coming here.
Katie H.,"Capitol Hill, Seattle, WA",5,9/23/2017,"ABSOLUTELY DIVINE. The best butter croissant in all of town!!! Delicious coffee to wash down that buttery flakey goodness. There are no wrong choices here. Also tried the goat cheese gallette, chocolate croissant, and almond croissant! All are delicious, but favorite is still the classic butter croissant. The owners are super nice and accommodating as well. Can't wait to be back!"
Jeni D.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/19/2017,"Beautiful pastries, and flaky and delicious like you'd only find in France. I was there today while waiting for the bus and had a ham and cheese croissant and a latte but couldn't resist the beautiful macarons and got two for later. The owners missed the handoff only latte order and were chatting with some of the local elderly folks. Seeing my impatience as I counted down the seconds before my bus arrive, they caught their mistake and made me a fast latte, and on my way out they gave me a bonus macaron for my patience. I have been wooed. Celine is a wonderful addition to our neighborhood, and is a destination for those outside it. You must try it!"
Renata P.,"Seattle, WA",5,10/27/2017,"We ordered a raspberry mascarpone entremet for a birthday and it was a huge success: beautifully decorated and deliciously delicately flavored. The owner was very warm and friendly from the moment he took the order through the phone until the moment we left the cafe. We tried some of the pains au chocolat and they were buttery, crispy and very tasty! Will definitely be back to try more of the pastries and meet this very sweet couple again."
Sarah G.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/30/2017,Stepping into Celine Patisserie is like traveling to Europe--it's hard to say exactly what it is but I was immediately taken by the feel of the decor and the gorgeous pastries. The Staff are extremely helpful and attentive. There is a great patio area out front and plenty of seating inside. The coffee is excellent. Did I mention the pastries? I indulged in a chocolate croissant and it is the best I've had in the States. They really got the buttery layers and chocolate just right. They've been open a month and I 100% recommend this be your new coffee and pastry spot. This is a wonderful new business and I'm sure soon to be a neighborhood favorite.
Anne D.,"Greenwood, Seattle, WA",4,8/29/2017,First time trying this place. Bought different kinds of pastries and quiche. Everything was wonderful. Friendly team and nice atmosphere.
Peter D.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/27/2017,My new favorite bakery in Seattle. Deliciousness and unpretentious vibe with personable owner. Nice selection of savory and sweet with various types of filled croissants. Perfect coffee too. Brought home a to-go box...
Alberto V.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/30/2017,"What a fantastic place! Pastries and coffee are so good! Try their Mocha, it's probably the best in town."
Laura V.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/20/2017,"Staff is very attentive and you can tell is a small business with owners that care. Atmosphere is nice, furniture is cool. I like the music as well and the fact that they make their own pastries. Coffee is good. I like it."
Daisy S.,"Olympia, WA",4,9/4/2017,"Very good pastries and a delicious cappuccino :) I'm not huge on the vibes in there, and the staff wasn't the most personable, so I'll take em to go next time."
Janna R.,"Seattle, WA",5,9/2/2017,Fantastic coffee and delicious pastries! Service was friendly and prices are very reasonable. A wonderful addition to the neighborhood!
Jessica K.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/26/2017,Excellent coffee. Excellent pastries. So happy to have Celine in the neighborhood. I have travelled all over Europe and Celine reminds me of my travels!
ST L.,"Seattle, WA",5,5/12/2018,I'm too lazy to write anything but this place is good. Good. Good good. Enough words?
Shelley M.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/24/2018,"Definitely as good as it gets! Pastries are fantastic, and include both sweet and savory. I want to try everything but so far am hooked by the pear frangipane danish. The people are lovely, there's plenty of seating, it has wi-fi, and it's air-conditioned!"
Jen A.,"Seattle, WA",5,2/5/2018,"Best croissants in all Seattle! And they have such an array: sweet, savory, with veggies, etc. I am so happy they opened. Perfect location near the zoo too."
Maya G.,"Bryn Mawr, PA",5,7/31/2017,"I came here before with my dad, and was greeted immediately by the very warm and inviting owner. My dad and I shared a delicious vegan cake, and were struck by the comfortable and clean environment. Celine Patisserie is an absolute must-try for any and everyone in the neighborhood."
Scott W.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/8/2017,"We are so pleased that Alexei and Daniela opened Celine Patisserie in our neighborhood! It's in the old Picnic space, handy to 8 Limbs Yoga. While our part of town is already blessed with Coyles and Rosselini, Celine is special. The croissants and pain au choc immediately take us back to France--they are perfect! We haven't tried all the desserts yet, but the walnut honey cake and the strawberry mousse were superb. Celine is expert at coffee, too, featuring the European Illy brand. And with prices lower than the competition, they represent tremendous value. Don't miss this excellent, family-run cafe!"
Karen T.,"Bellevue, WA",5,4/9/2018,"Delicious pastries and coffee, friendly staff and owners. Croissants stayed crispy for a few days after we bought them. Definitely a wonderful addition to patisseries in Seattle!"
Nora B.,"Camano Island, WA",5,8/5/2017,"Okay, I admit it; I'm a croissant snob. The ones they make here are some of the best I've ever had! Top that off with a couple of beautiful smiles from the guys behind the counter and you've got a winner!!!"
M M.,"Ballard, Seattle, WA",4,11/25/2017,This is a cute comfortable spot. The staff is friendly and the coffee is good. The croissants are flaky and buttery.  I'm especially a fan of the ham and cheese croissant.
Ray C.,"Seattle, WA",4,8/14/2017,"Finally went the other morning and had a tiramasu and a berry cream custard tart for breakfast...yeah breakfast. I enjoyed the tart, but the tiramasu was a bit heavy and on the dryish side. The owners were VERY VERY nice and I WILL return and try the savory items offered."
N S.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/23/2017,"Celine's is a great addition to Phinney Ridge. As good as it gets Illy coffee is the best. Whether it be plain drip (medium or dark roast) or the Latte, the coffee was fantastic (no more Starbucks for me). The on-site made pastries and desserts were delicious. We have tried the Monkey Bread, Galette, Danish, Croissants (various kinds), and the Tiramisu. All were delicious and not overtly sweet, like most store bought pastry. All were light and fluffy. Sit inside or out, it is all as good as it gets."
Eileen K.,"Seattle, WA",5,12/27/2017,"Celine's is excellent.  The coffee is superb and served in beautiful cups. The owners are always there welcoming everyone warmly, and offering to warm your pastry."
Josh W.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/11/2017,Clearly passionate about what they do.  I've spent a long time living in France and this compares favorably to the best patisseries I found there.
Laurel D.,"Salt Lake City, UT",5,9/4/2017,"So happy to have this perfect bakery in our neighborhood. Celine has awesome pastries, both sweet and savory. I love illy coffee and the baristas do an amazing job and bringing out its flavors with their various drinks. Definitely a must-visit!"
Sonia K.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/26/2017,"This place is adorable! Was doing laundry nearby and saw the good reviews for FRENCH pastries! (I have a weakness for good French baking.) I had a peach danish and tea. The danish was delicious and flaky with a crispy crust, without being heavy. The man at the counter was so sweet, and very attentive to my small order."
Anne B.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/20/2017,Of all the coffee and pastries shops in the Seattle area that I have tried Celine has the most authentic French fare I've experienced. If you want a short trip to France this is the place to go.
Ann D.,"Seattle, WA",5,11/3/2017,"Absolutely one of the best patisseries in Seattle. Lovely Lovely selection with both classics and seasonal items. Rivals the best bakeries in Paris! Particularly enjoyed their croissant's, light and flaky in classic almond and chocolate incarnations. Great selection of beverages. Super fresh great coffee. Very refreshing and a wonderful find. Will be back again soon. Left with a large bag of take-home goodies."
Glenda E.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/27/2017,Legit and delicious.  One of the best almond croissants I have had in this city.
Steve B.,"Leavenworth, WA",5,7/27/2018,"awesome authentic pastries at a reasonable price, good portion sizes and very clean set up"
Niamh C.,"Seattle, WA",5,7/22/2017,Pastries taste just like what you would find in Europe if not better. Coffee is strong. The staff are super friendly. Makes you just want to give them your business and they sure appreciate their customers!
Judy C.,"Seattle, WA",5,1/26/2018,"So thrilled to have this bakery in my neighborhood!  Stopped in a few months back when I drove by.  I had no idea they were here in the old Picnic Deli spot.  The owners have created a really fantastic bakery that offers wonderful croissants, quiches and more.  Everything I have eaten has been amazingly yummy.   They also have a pretty darn fantastic expresso which the mocha comes with fresh whipped cream with chocolate drizzle on the side.  ( I did find out their Venti size has 4 shots but you can ask for less shots lol)  The owners provide wonderful customer service is bringing me back.  I have had a few friends come with me to experience and they love it too. There is seating inside and front patio, it is a pleasant experience to sit down and share coffee and pastries with friends.  Yay to Celine Patisserie for coming to Phinney hill!     Also, if you take your croissants home, just pop them into the oven say at 300 degrees for 5-10 minutes and they will melt in your mouth!"
